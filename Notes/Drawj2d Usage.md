# **Using drawj2d with Remarkable Tablets: A Comprehensive Guide**

The reMarkable tablet has gained considerable popularity as a digital paper device, offering a unique writing and reading experience that closely mimics traditional paper. While the tablet provides intuitive tools for handwriting and basic sketching, users seeking to create precise technical drawings or integrate specific document types in an editable format may find the need for specialized software. drawj2d is one such tool, designed as a command-line application capable of generating technical line drawings in vector formats like PDF and SVG 1. Notably, drawj2d also possesses the functionality to directly create files compatible with the reMarkable tablet's notebook formats (.rmdoc, .rmn, .rm), enabling users to produce drawings and documents that can be further edited on their device 1. Although its primary function is to facilitate the creation of scaled technical drawings, drawj2d also offers valuable capabilities for converting text and PDF files into editable templates for reMarkable users 1. This makes it a versatile tool for those who require a level of precision and control beyond the tablet's native drawing features.

## **Getting Started with Drawj2d**

To begin using drawj2d with a reMarkable tablet, it is essential to first ensure the necessary software is installed on your computer. Drawj2d is a desktop application that requires the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to function 1. This means that users will need to have JRE installed on their Windows, macOS, or Linux system to run drawj2d. To check if JRE is already installed, users can open their command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux) and type java \-version. If Java is installed, the system will display version information. If not, users will need to download and install JRE from the official Oracle website or an open-source alternative like OpenJDK, ensuring they select the appropriate version for their operating system. The dependency on JRE indicates that drawj2d operates on a computer and serves as a complementary tool to the reMarkable tablet, requiring users to transfer files between the two devices. This setup is crucial to understand as it positions drawj2d as a part of a workflow rather than an application installed directly on the tablet.  
Drawj2d is operated through a command-line interface (CLI), where users interact with the software by typing text-based commands 1. For users unfamiliar with the command line, this might initially seem like a complex way to interact with software. On Windows, the command prompt can be accessed by searching for "cmd" in the start menu. On macOS and Linux, the terminal application can be found in the utilities folder or accessed via a system-wide search. A basic drawj2d command typically consists of the executable name (drawj2d), followed by various options that specify the desired output format and potentially input file names. For example, a common command to create a reMarkable notebook file from a drawing described in a file named mydrawing.hcl is drawj2d \-Trmdoc mydrawing.hcl. While the command-line interface might present an initial hurdle for some users accustomed to graphical interfaces, the specific commands required for using drawj2d with a reMarkable tablet are generally well-defined and relatively simple, especially when following provided examples. This focused usage minimizes the need for extensive command-line expertise.

## **Creating Drawings for Remarkable Tablets**

Drawj2d utilizes a plain text file, conventionally saved with the .hcl extension, to define the elements and properties of the drawing 1. This text-based language allows for precise control over every aspect of the drawing, making it well-suited for creating technical diagrams and illustrations where accuracy is paramount. The .hcl language includes a variety of commands to draw basic shapes such as line, circle, and rect, as well as commands like moveto and lineto for creating more complex paths. Text labels can be added using the label command. Coordinates for these elements are specified in natural units, with millimeters (\[mm\]) being a frequently used unit, particularly when the drawing is intended for display on the reMarkable's screen, which has physical dimensions measured in millimeters 1. The use of this descriptive language provides a significant advantage for users who need to create drawings with specific dimensions and precise placements, a level of accuracy that can be challenging to achieve with freehand drawing tools.  
To illustrate the basic syntax, consider a few examples. To draw a rectangle with its top-left corner at coordinates (10, 10\) and a width of 50 mm and a height of 30 mm, the .hcl command would be rect 10 10 50 30\. To generate a reMarkable notebook file from this description, the command would be drawj2d \-Trmdoc rectangle.hcl. Similarly, to draw a horizontal line starting at (20, 40\) and ending at (80, 40\) with a label positioned near it, the .hcl code might look like this: moveto 20 40; lineto 80 40; label 85 42 "Horizontal Line". The corresponding drawj2d command would be drawj2d \-Trmdoc line\_label.hcl. For reMarkable Paper Pro users who wish to add color, the pen command can be used. For instance, to draw a blue circle centered at (50, 50\) with a radius of 20 mm, the .hcl code would be pen inkblue; circle 50 50 20;, and the drawj2d command would be drawj2d \-Trmdoc colored\_circle.hcl. These examples demonstrate the straightforward nature of the .hcl language for creating basic geometric shapes and annotations.  
When creating drawings intended for a reMarkable tablet, it is important to consider the screen dimensions of the device. The reMarkable 2 has an approximate screen width of 157 mm and a height of 209 mm, while the reMarkable Paper Pro offers a slightly larger screen with a width of approximately 179 mm and a height of 239 mm 3. These dimensions serve as a guide for users to plan the scale and layout of their drawings within the .hcl file, especially when using millimeters as the unit. Before generating the final reMarkable file, users can preview their drawing on their computer screen using the \-Tscreen option along with the \-W (width) and \-H (height) parameters. For a reMarkable 2 preview, the command would be something like drawj2d \-Tscreen \-W157 \-H209 mydrawing.hcl 2. These width and height values should roughly correspond to the target reMarkable device's screen dimensions to provide an accurate representation of how the drawing will appear. For reMarkable Paper Pro users, it is crucial to note that this model has a higher resolution than the reMarkable 2\. To ensure that drawings are rendered at the correct scale on the Paper Pro, users should include the \-r parameter followed by the resolution value (229 for rmPro) when generating the .rmdoc file. The command would then look like drawj2d \-Trmdoc \-r229 mydrawing.hcl 1. Paying attention to these screen dimensions and resolution parameters is vital for ensuring that the generated drawings fit appropriately and are displayed at the intended scale on the user's specific reMarkable model, avoiding issues such as unwanted cropping or incorrect sizing.  
For users of the reMarkable Paper Pro, drawj2d version 1.3.4 introduced the capability to include color in the generated reMarkable notebooks 1. This feature allows for more visually informative technical drawings. The software recognizes a specific set of color names that correspond to the colors available on the reMarkable Pro. These include black, grey, white, blue (specified as inkblue), red (specified as inkred), green (specified as darkgreen), yellow (specified as orange), cyan, magenta (specified as violet or purple), as well as the highlighter colors pink, lightgray, lightgreen, and lightyellow 1. It is important to note the specific mappings used by drawj2d; for instance, the color name inkblue in the .hcl file will be interpreted as blue on the reMarkable Pro. Similarly, darkgray maps to black, darkgreen to green, orange to yellow, darkorange to red, brown to gray, and both violet and purple map to magenta 1. If any other color name is used in the .hcl file, drawj2d will map it to black, grey, or white based on its brightness 1. To specify a color for drawing elements, the pen command is used followed by the desired color name, for example, pen lightgray; to draw in light gray 1. This specific color palette and the defined mapping rules mean that reMarkable Pro users need to be mindful of the exact color names used in their .hcl files to achieve the intended color output. Experimentation might be necessary to become fully familiar with how different color names are rendered on the device.

## **Converting Text Files to Remarkable Notebooks**

Beyond creating drawings from scratch, drawj2d also offers the functionality to convert plain text files into editable reMarkable notebook pages 2. This can be particularly useful for users who want to create simple text-based templates, bring notes from other applications onto their reMarkable, or generate documents from textual data. A crucial requirement for this process is that the text file must be saved using UTF-8 encoding to ensure that all characters, including special symbols and characters from various languages, are rendered correctly on the reMarkable 2. Most modern text editors provide an option to select UTF-8 encoding when saving a file. For example, in Notepad on Windows, this option is available in the "Save As" dialog under the "Encoding" dropdown. Similarly, TextEdit on macOS allows users to choose UTF-8 encoding when saving a document. Ensuring the correct encoding is selected will prevent potential issues with character display on the reMarkable.  
To perform the text conversion, drawj2d utilizes a pre-written script file named write.hcl 2. This script contains the necessary commands to read the content of a specified text file and format it as a reMarkable notebook page. The command-line syntax to use this script for conversion is drawj2d \-Trmdoc write.hcl your\_text\_file.txt, where your\_text\_file.txt should be replaced with the actual name of the text file you wish to convert 2. The write.hcl script itself, as provided in the documentation, includes comments explaining its usage and the basic logic it follows 2. It first checks if a text file argument has been provided. Then, it opens and reads the content of the specified text file. The script sets the font to a single-line "hershey" font named "Lines" with a size of 3.5 mm 2. It also defines the starting position of the text on the page, setting it 15 mm from the left border and 5 mm from the top, likely to avoid the reMarkable's menu bar 2. The maximum width of each text line is set to 138 mm. Finally, the script iterates through each line of the text file and writes it to the reMarkable notebook. This pre-configured script simplifies the process of converting text to a format suitable for the reMarkable.  
While the write.hcl script offers a convenient way to convert text, it's important to be aware of its limitations. The script relies on a single, simple line font ("Lines"), which, while supporting a range of characters including Basic Latin, Latin-1, Greek, Latvian, Polish, and Russian glyphs, lacks the visual complexity of more advanced fonts 2. TrueType fonts are not directly supported in this conversion method and will only render as outlines if used otherwise 3. Additionally, the write.hcl script does not automatically handle page breaks. It will continue writing text on a single, potentially very long, reMarkable page 2. However, the continuous pages functionality of reMarkable software version 3.0 and later allows users to scroll through extensive documents without explicit page breaks 2. It is also worth noting that the text generated through this method is rendered as drawn lines, not as selectable and editable text objects in the same way as text typed directly on the reMarkable using its "keyboard text" feature (introduced in software version 3.0), which is not supported by drawj2d 2. Therefore, users should understand that this text conversion is primarily intended for displaying plain text in a basic format, and they should not expect advanced formatting or the same level of text editability as natively created text on the reMarkable.

## **Converting PDF Files to Remarkable Notebooks**

Drawj2d also provides a method for converting single-page PDF files into editable reMarkable notebook files 2. This functionality can be particularly useful for bringing existing documents, such as worksheets, diagrams, or annotated PDFs, onto the reMarkable for further use. The basic command-line syntax for converting an A5 sized PDF without any scaling is echo image pageA5.pdf | drawj2d \-Trmdoc, where pageA5.pdf should be replaced with the actual filename of the PDF 2. For converting an A4 sized PDF to fit the reMarkable 2 screen, the command is echo image pageA4.pdf 1 0 0 0.7 | drawj2d \-Trmdoc, with the scaling factor of 0.7 reducing the A4 page to a size suitable for the reMarkable's display 2. For the slightly larger screen of the reMarkable Paper Pro, a scaling factor of 0.8 is recommended for A4 PDFs, resulting in the command echo image pageA4.pdf 1 0 0 0.8 | drawj2d \-Trmdoc 3. These commands typically generate an output file named out.rmdoc in the directory where the command is executed 2.  
A key aspect of drawj2d's PDF conversion is that it interprets the vector data within the PDF and redraws it as lines in the reMarkable notebook format 3. This process makes the content editable on the tablet, allowing users to annotate, erase, and interact with the converted document as if it were created natively. However, it is important to note that fonts within the PDF are rendered as outlines, meaning they will lose their original font style and will appear as vector graphics rather than selectable text objects 3. Additionally, raster images embedded within the PDF are handled differently and do not utilize any pen color settings from drawj2d 1. Furthermore, color information from the PDF is only preserved if the colors exactly match the supported color definitions of the reMarkable Pro. If the colors in the PDF do not precisely correspond to these definitions, they may be converted to black, grey, or white 1. This means that while PDF conversion offers a way to bring documents onto the reMarkable for editing, the transformation to line drawings and the rendering of fonts as outlines will likely alter the visual appearance of the original PDF. Users should anticipate a functional representation of the content but not necessarily a pixel-perfect replica.  
To accommodate PDFs of different page sizes or to achieve specific zoom levels, the scaling factor in the image command can be adjusted. For more advanced options regarding scaling and positioning, users can consult the Drawj2d manual 3. For instance, to embed a specific page of a PDF, such as page 5 of an A4 document, with scaling and right justification for the reMarkable 2, the command would be moveto 9 0; image article.pdf 5 0 0 0.7; 3. A similar command for the reMarkable Pro would be image article.pdf 5 0 0 0.8; 3. While the basic image command in drawj2d is designed for single-page PDF conversion, users who need to convert multi-page PDFs will need to explore alternative tools. The documentation suggests using pdf2rmnotebook (a Linux tool), rmn-combine (a Perl script), or rmcat for handling multi-page PDF documents 2. Links to these tools are often provided in the drawj2d documentation, offering solutions for users dealing with larger documents. The need for these external tools highlights that drawj2d's built-in PDF conversion is primarily focused on single pages.

## **Transferring Notebooks to Your Remarkable Tablet**

Once a drawing, text conversion, or PDF conversion is completed using drawj2d, the resulting reMarkable notebook file (.rmdoc, .rmn, or .rm) needs to be transferred to the tablet. There are several methods available for this process, catering to different user preferences and technical setups. The .rmdoc format is generally the most compatible with the official reMarkable desktop application, which is available for Windows and macOS 1. To transfer a .rmdoc file using the desktop app, users simply need to connect their reMarkable tablet to their computer via a USB cable and open the application. The .rmdoc file can then be dragged and dropped into the app window. The application will then synchronize the file to the reMarkable tablet via the reMarkable cloud service.  
Another convenient method for transferring .rmdoc files is by using the reMarkable's built-in USB web interface 1. To access this interface, the reMarkable tablet needs to be connected to the computer via a USB cable. On the tablet, users need to enable USB web access in the settings menu. Once enabled, the tablet will display a web address. By navigating to this address in a web browser on the connected computer, users will be able to access a simple interface that allows them to upload files, including the .rmdoc file generated by drawj2d. This method provides a straightforward way to transfer files without requiring the desktop application.  
For users who prefer a dedicated desktop application for managing their reMarkable tablet, RCU (reMarkable Connection Utility) is a popular third-party option 3. RCU is a cross-platform application available for Windows, Linux, Mac, and FreeBSD. It supports the upload of .rmn files, which are generated by drawj2d using the \-Trmn option 2. While RCU is a paid application, many users find it valuable for its ease of use and additional features for managing their reMarkable device, particularly for those who prefer local or offline file transfers. The RCU website ([http://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/](http://www.davisr.me/projects/rcu/)) provides more information about its features and purchasing options.  
Finally, for more technically inclined users, rMAPI is a command-line tool that allows interaction with the reMarkable cloud service 3. rMAPI can be used to upload both .rm and .rmdoc files to the reMarkable using commands such as rmapi put your\_file.rmdoc 3. The first time rMAPI is used, it requires a one-time authentication process where the user needs to enter a code obtained by logging into their reMarkable account. rMAPI offers a more programmatic way to manage files on the reMarkable, which can be useful for automation or for users who are comfortable with command-line interfaces. The rMAPI GitHub repository ([https://github.com/ddvk/rmapi/releases](https://github.com/ddvk/rmapi/releases)) provides installation instructions and usage details. Once the transfer is complete using any of these methods, the notebook created by drawj2d will appear on the reMarkable tablet and can be opened and edited like any other notebook created directly on the device.

## **Limitations and Important Considerations**

When using drawj2d with reMarkable tablets, there are several limitations and important considerations to keep in mind to ensure a smooth and effective workflow. As previously mentioned, color support in drawj2d-generated notebooks is exclusive to the reMarkable Paper Pro and follows a specific set of mapping rules between drawj2d color names and the colors available on the device. Users of the reMarkable 2 should be aware that any color specifications in their drawj2d input files will result in monochrome output (black, grey, or white).  
The way drawj2d handles images (PNG and SVG) is also an important factor. When converting these file types, drawj2d approximates the images using parallel monochrome lines 1. The visual quality of the converted image can vary significantly depending on the complexity and resolution of the original image. For PNG images, the current pen color set in drawj2d (since version 1.3.4) will be used for these monochrome lines 1. It is generally advisable to avoid using images with very high resolutions (significantly above 200 dpi) as this can lead to densely packed and potentially unreadable line approximations on the reMarkable 3. Raster images embedded within PDF files are treated differently and do not utilize the drawj2d pen color 1. Due to this approximation method, drawj2d is not ideally suited for converting photographs or highly detailed graphical images. It is more effective for simpler diagrams or scanned documents where the underlying line structure is more critical.  
Another key consideration is the rendering of fonts. When drawj2d converts PDF files, the fonts within the PDF are interpreted and redrawn as vector outlines in the reMarkable notebook format 3. This means that while the text becomes editable as lines, it loses its original font style and might appear visually different on the tablet. Drawj2d does offer specific single-line fonts (Lines, Lines italic, LinesMono) that can be used when creating drawings or when using the write.hcl script for text conversion 3. TrueType fonts used in .hcl files will also be rendered as outlines 3. This limitation in font rendering is inherent to the reMarkable's native notebook format and is an important factor for users to be aware of when creating or converting documents using drawj2d.

## **Conclusion**

Drawj2d presents a valuable tool for reMarkable tablet users who require the precision of vector graphics and the ability to create editable technical drawings or convert specific document types for use on their device. While its command-line interface might pose an initial learning curve for some, the focused commands for reMarkable integration are relatively straightforward. The ability to create drawings using a descriptive language, convert text files for basic note-taking templates, and transform single-page PDFs into editable notebooks expands the functionality of the reMarkable beyond its native capabilities. However, users should be mindful of the limitations, particularly regarding color support (exclusive to reMarkable Pro), the approximation of raster images, and the rendering of fonts as outlines. By understanding these aspects and leveraging the available resources, reMarkable owners can effectively integrate drawj2d into their workflow to meet specific needs for technical drawing and document handling.
