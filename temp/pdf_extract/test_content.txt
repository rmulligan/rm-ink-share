Test Document for Remarkable

This is a simple test document to verify that text content is properly converted to an editable format on the Remarkable tablet.

The key requirements:
- Content must be editable on the tablet
- Text should be rendered using the Lines font
- Document should be properly formatted

When converting web content:
1. Extract the main text content
2. Format it as plain text
3. Use the text_to_remarkable.py script to create a document
4. Upload to the Remarkable tablet

This approach is based on the successful md2rm tool which creates editable content on the Remarkable tablet.
