# Creating Editable Content for Remarkable Tablets

## Final Solution: Lines Font with Direct RM Conversion

After extensive testing with various approaches, we've successfully implemented a solution that creates properly filled, editable content on Remarkable tablets by using the Lines font family with direct RM conversion.

## Key Discoveries

1. **Character Display Issue**: When using standard fonts or the text_to_path command, text appears as outlines instead of filled characters on the Remarkable tablet.

2. **Solution - Lines Font**: The key to properly filled characters is using the Lines (Hershey) font family that's built into drawj2d.

3. **Direct Text Command**: Using the simple `text` command (not `text_to_path`) with the Lines font creates properly filled, editable text.

4. **Native RM Format**: The `-Trm` output format works best for creating editable content with filled characters.

## Technical Implementation

Our implementation makes these key changes:

1. **Font Selection**:
   ```python
   # Use Lines font exclusively
   puts "set_font Lines 24"
   puts "text 100 100 \"Properly filled text\""
   ```

2. **Conversion Process**:
   ```python
   # Convert directly to RM format
   cmd = [DRAWJ2D_PATH, "-Trm", "-o", output_path, hcl_path]
   ```

3. **Simplified Approach**:
   - Generate HCL content using Lines font
   - Convert directly to RM format
   - Package as RMDOC if needed (for better document organization)
   - Fallback to PDF only as a last resort

## Code Changes

### HCL Script Generation
- Updated to use only Lines font family
- Simplified the page structure
- Used standard Remarkable dimensions (1404x1872)
- Used text command with proper font names

### RM/RMDOC Conversion
- Simplified to directly convert to RM format
- Added a fallback to create RMDOC if needed
- Improved error handling with graceful degradation

## Testing Results

Our test files confirm that:
1. The Lines font displays with properly filled characters
2. The content is editable on the Remarkable tablet
3. The RM format preserves editability

## Best Practices

When creating content for Remarkable:
1. Always use the Lines font family (Lines, Lines-Italic, LinesMono)
2. Use the native RM format (-Trm) when possible
3. Keep layouts simple for best compatibility
4. Prefer direct text commands over text-to-path

## Limitations and Considerations

1. **Image Handling**: Images will be converted to monochrome line approximations

2. **Font Selection**: Only Lines, Lines-Italic, and LinesMono fonts will appear properly filled

3. **Remarkable Pro**: Color support is available for Remarkable Pro with specific color names

4. **Format Tradeoffs**:
   - RM files: Best editability
   - RMDOC files: Best organization
   - PDF files: Most reliable display but not editable

## Conclusion

The key to creating editable content with properly filled characters on Remarkable tablets is using the Lines font family with the text command and the native RM format. This approach ensures that text appears correctly filled and remains editable on the tablet.
