## Remarkable Pro Compatibility

This application is optimized for the Remarkable Pro tablet with its larger 1872Ã—2404 pixel screen dimensions. If you're using a different Remarkable device, you may need to adjust the dimensions in `app/services/document_service.py`.

## Troubleshooting

Check the log file at `pi_share_receiver.log` for detailed error information.

Common issues:
- **Upload failures**: Ensure rmapi is properly authenticated
- **Conversion errors**: Check that drawj2d is correctly installed
- **Blank documents**: May indicate web scraping issues with complex sites
